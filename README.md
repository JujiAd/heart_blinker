# ESP32 Blinking Heart

This is a simple project utilizing an ESP32, a 100 Ohm resistor, and an LED to create a blinking heart display piece. The ESP32 hosts a simple web server and is configured to blink the heart upon receiving a POST request. In this way, the heart can be activated from a HomeAssistant server remotely.
